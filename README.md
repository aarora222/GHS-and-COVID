# GHS-and-COVID
Visualising and exploring data from the JHU GHS index project and the WHO.

I am learning how to visualise and interpret data, with an interest towards biostatistics, and my friend Kevin Wang suggested I look at the Global Health Security Index data provided by Johns Hopkins University in relation to the COVID-19 data provided by the World Health Organisation.

In this repository are the data files I use, taken from the GHS and WHO websites, and some R code that uses ggplot2 to visualise the relationship between various variables (particularly index score vs death rate).
